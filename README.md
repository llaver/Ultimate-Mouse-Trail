# The Obsession

This project started almost 15 years ago in an entirely different form, it has gone through many iterations in many different languages, none of them diverse enough to run on all operating systems while still being powerful enough to perform heavy calculations and large loops very quickly. 

# The Solution

Electron

# The Launch

Run the following commands:

 * npm install 
 * npm run start

or

 * yarn
 * yarn start
 
 Then click start

# TODO
 * Create more modules
 * Build UI for on the fly customization
