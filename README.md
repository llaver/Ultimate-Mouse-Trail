# The Obsession

This project started 10 years ago, it has gone through many iterations in many different languages, none of them diverse enough to run on all operating systems while still being specific enough to do everything I needed it to. 

# The Solution

Electron

# The Launch

Run the following commands:

 * npm install 
 * npm run start

or

 * yarn
 * yarn start
 
 Then click start

# TODO
 * Move Mouse Listeners, mouse position vars, trail positions array to higher level class
